## Viewing Files
__cat__ Used for viewing files that are not very long; it does not provide any scroll-back.

__tac__ Used to look at a file backwards, starting with the last line.

__less__ Used to view larger files because it is a paging program; it pauses at each screenful of text, provides scroll-back capabilities, and lets you search and navigate within the file. Note: Use __/__ to search for a pattern in the forward direction and __?__ for a pattern in the backward direction.

__tail__ Used to print the last 10 lines of a file by default. You can change the number of lines by doing __-n 15__ or just __-15__ if you wanted to look at the last 15 lines instead of the default.

__head__ The opposite of tail; by default it prints the first 10 lines of a file.


### touch and mkdir


__touch__ is often used to set or update the access, change, and modify times of files. By default it resets a file's time stamp to match the current time.

However, you can also create an __empty__ file using __touch__:

`$ touch <filename>`

__touch__ provides several options, but here is one of interest: the __-t__ option allows you to set the date and time stamp of the file.

To set the time stamp to a specific time:

`$ touch -t 03201600 myfile`

This sets the file, myfile's, time stamp to 4 p.m., March 20th (03 20 1600).

__mkdir__ is used to create a directory.

* To create a sample directory named _sampdir_ under the current directory, type `mkdir sampdir`.
* To create a sample directory called _sampdir_ under _/usr_, type `mkdir /usr/sampdir`.


### Renaming or Removing a Directory/File

Removing a directory is simply done with __rmdir__. The directory must be empty or it will fail.

While typing __rm –rf__ is a fast and easy way to remove a whole filesystem tree recursively, it is extremely dangerous and should be used with the utmost care, especially when used by root. Below are the commands used to rename or remove a directory/file:

__mv__	Rename a directory/file

__rmdir__	Remove an empty directory

__rm__	Remove a file 

__rm –i__	Interactively remove a file

__rm -rf__	Forcefully remove a directory recursively
